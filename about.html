                    I was born in San Jose, California. My parents moved to Vancouver, Washington when I was about a year and a half. Since then I have lived most of my live in Vancouver. I picked up my first DSLR camera when I was in 8th grade. It wasn't until early high school when I started learning what a camera can actually do.

                <p>
                    I attended the Vancouver School of Arts and Academics &#40;VSAA&#41; for all four years of high school. VSAA is a public school in which the arts are immersed in academic study. While attending VSAA I focused in Visual Arts and Moving Image Arts.

                    After graduating high school in 2017 I moved to Ellensburg, Washington to attend Central Washington University for a year. I then spent my summer in Santa Cruz, California. I really enjoyed photographing the beautiful coast. In fall of 2018 I moved back to Vancouver to attended Clark Community College. It was at the end of 2019 that I really started to pick up my camera more. I started taking short trips, going on hikes, chasing the sunset while working towards my Direct Transfer Degree and working as a barista at Peet's Coffee and Tea.

                    In October of 2019 I started to post more regularly to social media. I started networking and meeting up with other photographers in the Portland/Vancouver area to shoot landscape. Early 2020 I started to reach out to car owners in the local community to photograph their vehicles. COVID-19 then hit Washington State and we were shut down. During quarantine I proceeded to venture into nature as much as I could keep my mental health up.

                <p>
                    Post quarantine I started reaching out to people again to meetup for sunrise or to schedule a photoshoot for their car. Once people started posting my images on their social media I had more people reaching out for photos.

                    Now I attend Western Washington University full-time while working as a part-time barista. I am majoring in psychology and minoring in user experience design. In my free time I do my best to pick up my camera and capture the moment.

                  To me photography is not just a hobby, but a lifestyle and passion. I love being able to capture a genuine smile, a breathtaking sunset or the work of art vehicles can be.
