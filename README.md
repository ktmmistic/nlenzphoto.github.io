Final Project for CSCI202 at Western Washington University.

This website is the groundwork for my photography website I hope to publish in the near feature. I would like my website to have an active shop rather then sending off to a third party. For quite a while I have wanted a website to not only showcase my work, but also make prints avaliable. I am very excited to take the first steps into launching a website not only show casing my photography, but my html coding as well.
